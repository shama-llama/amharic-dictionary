# Documentation on the Amharic Dictionary

This document outlines the different orthographic reforms, punctuation standards, dictionary structure, abbreviations, and layout of dictionary entries used in the Amharic Dictionary published in 1993 E.C. by the Ethiopian Languages Research Center (ELRC).

## 1. Orthography: The New Alphabet (Fidel) System

The dictionary uses a revised Amharic alphabet (ፊደል) based on a decision by the former Academy of Ethiopian Languages to simplify and standardize Amharic usage.

### A. Elimination of Homophones (ሞክሼ ፊደላት)

For sets of characters with identical pronunciation, only one character is used throughout the dictionary.

*   **ሀ** is used exclusively; **ሐ** is not used.
*   **ሰ** is used exclusively; **ሠ** is not used.
*   **አ** is used exclusively; **ዐ** is not used.
*   **ጸ** is used exclusively; **ፀ** is not used.

### B. Redefinition of Specific Characters

The usage rules for two characters have been modified, making two other characters obsolete within this system.

1.  **The Character 'ሀ' (hä)**
    *   The 4th form **ሃ (ha)** is no longer used.
    *   The 1st form **ሀ (hä)** now also represents the sound of **ኸ (khä)** in pronunciation.
    *   **Example:** The word `ይኸው` (yəhəw - "this one") is now written as `ይሀው`. When reading `ይሀው`, it should be pronounced as if it were `ይኸው`.
    *   This change makes the character **ኸ** and all its forms (ኩ, ኪ, ካ, ኬ, ክ, ኮ) redundant, and they are not used in this dictionary.

2.  **The Character 'አ' (ä)**
    *   The 4th form **ኣ (a)** is no longer used.
    *   The 1st form **አ (ä)** now also represents the sound of **ኧ (ə)**.
    *   **Example:** The word `ኧረ` (ərä - "hey!" or "really!") is now written as `አረ`. The character `አ` takes the place and sound of `ኧ`.
    *   This change makes the character **ኧ** obsolete, and it is not used.

### C. Simplification of Labialized Characters (ፍንፅቆች)

Many complex labialized characters (those with a "w" sound) are replaced by simpler, more common forms.

| Obsolete Form | Replaced By | Example Usage (in the document) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **ቈ** (qwä) | **ቆ** (qo) | `ቈ` is replaced by `ቆ` |
| **ቊ** (qwi) | **ቁ** (qu) | `ቊ` is replaced by `ቁ` |
| **ኰ** (kwä) | **ኮ** (ko) | `ኰ` is replaced by `ኮ` |
| **ኲ** (kwi) | **ኩ** (ku) | `ኲ` is replaced by `ኩ` |
| **ጐ** (gwä) | **ጎ** (go) | `ጐ` is replaced by `ጎ` |
| **ጕ** (gwi) | **ጉ** (gu) | `ጕ` is replaced by `ጉ` |
| **ኋ** (hwa) | **ሧ** (shwa) | The character `ኋ` is replaced by `ሧ`<sup>1</sup> |

*Note: The primary labialized forms retained are **ቋ, ኳ, ጓ**.*

<sup>1 The actual letter used is the `ሗ` form of `ሃ` which doesn't exist in Unicode. So `ሧ` is the closest match the OCR can identify.</sup>

### D. Placement of 'ቨ' (vä)

The character **ቨ** and its family (ቩ, ቪ, ቫ, ቬ, ቭ, ቮ) are placed immediately after the **በ** family (በ, ቡ, ቢ, ባ, ቤ, ብ, ቦ) due to their phonetic and visual similarity.

## 4. How to Find a Word (የሚፈለገው ቃል የት / እንዴት ይገኛል?)

### A. Headwords (መነሻ ቃላት)

*   **Verbs:** The main entry for a verb is always its root form in the **3rd person, masculine, singular, past tense**.
    *   **Example:** To find any word related to "breaking," such as "breakage" (`ስብራት`) or "it was broken" (`ተሰበረ`), you must look up the root verb **ሰበረ** (säbärä - *he broke*).

*   **Nouns and Other Words:** Nouns, adjectives, and other non-verb words are listed as their own headwords in alphabetical order.

*   **Hypothetical/Archaic Roots:** Some words are preceded by an asterisk (`*`). This indicates that the word is a hypothetical or archaic root form that is no longer in common use, is used only in a specific region, or is presented as a theoretical base for derived words.
    *   **Example:** `*ወለበ`

*   **Descriptive Words with Helper Verbs:** Words that describe sounds, actions, or states, which cannot stand alone, are paired with a helper verb like `ኣለ` (to say/be).
    *   **Example:** **ግው ኣለ** (gəw alä - to make a thudding sound; to flare up). The entry is under `ግው`.

### B. Derived Words (ውልድ ቃላት)

*   Derived words (nouns, adjectives, and different verb forms) are listed as indented sub-entries under their root headword.
    *   **Example:** `ስብራት` (breakage) and `ሽልማት` (award) are found under the headwords **ሰበረ** (to break) and **ሸለመ** (to award), respectively.

*   **Words with Prefixes (`ተ-`, `አ-`, `አስ-`):** Derived verbs that begin with common prefixes (like the passive `ተ-` or causative `አ-`/`አስ-`) are generally **not** listed as separate headwords. The user must identify the root and look it up.
    *   **Example:** To find **ተሰበረ** (it was broken), you must go to the root entry **ሰበረ**.
    *   A word index in the appendix can be consulted for difficult-to-trace roots.

### C. Compound Words (ጥምር ቃላት)

*   Compound words are typically defined under the entry for the **first word** in the compound.
    *   **Example:** **ቤተክርስትያን** (church) is found under the entry for **ቤት** (house).
    *   **Example:** **ማብሪያና ማጥፊያ** (on/off switch) is found under the entry for **በራ** (to be lit).

## 5. Components of an Entry

Each entry is broken down into several parts, presented in a specific order. The following table explains each component using examples drawn directly from the guide.

| Component | Example from Text | Explanation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Headword** | `ለመለመ` | The primary word being defined, shown in **bold** at the left margin. |
| **Alternative Form** | `ለመዘገ (መዘለገ)` | An alternative spelling or a different root form of the headword, shown in parentheses `( )` immediately following it. |
| **Homonym Disambiguation**| `ለመለመ`<sup>1</sup> <br> `ለመለመ`<sup>2</sup> | A number following an identically spelled word. It distinguishes between words with different origins or meanings (e.g., `ለመለመ 1` - "to be green" vs. `ለመለመ 2` - "to trim leaves"). |
| **Part of Speech** | `ለምለም` ቅ. | An abbreviation (`ቅ.` for Adjective, `ግ.` for Verb, `ስ.` for Noun) that indicates the word's grammatical function. |
| **Numbered Definitions** | `ለመለመ` ግ. <br> 1. ... 2. ... | When a word has multiple distinct meanings, they are numbered sequentially. |
| **Context/Field/Tone Label** | `ለበናም` ቅ. (ስድብ) <br> `ላባ ኳስ` ስ. (ስፖ.) <br> `ሊጦን` ስ. (ኢ.ኦ.ተ.ቤ.) | A label in parentheses `( )` that appears *before* a definition to specify its context. This can indicate tone (`(ስድብ)` - Insult), a specific field (`(ስፖ.)` - Sports), or a source (`(ኢ.ኦ.ተ.ቤ.)` - EOTC). |
| **Figurative Meaning** | `ምላጭ` ስ. ... 3. /ዘይ./ ... | The label `/ዘይ./` (for `ዘይቤያዊ` - Figurative) is used to mark a definition that is idiomatic or metaphorical. |
| **Definition** | ...ቅጠል ኣወጣ፥ ኣቆጠቆጠ... | The explanation of the word's meaning. |
| **Synonyms/Alternatives** | `ላብ ኣጠመቀው /ኣሰጠመው` | A slash `/` is used to separate synonymous or equivalent words and phrases within a definition or example sentence. Commas (`፥`) are also used for this purpose. |
| **Example Sentence** | ለምለም ሳር ። | A short phrase or sentence that demonstrates how the word is used in context. |
| **Derived Word** | `ለመለመ` <br> &ensp;`ለምለም` | A word formed from the headword (e.g., an adjective from a verb). It is listed as an indented, bold sub-entry with its own part of speech and definition. |
| **Idiomatic Phrase** | `ለበኑን ጣለ` | A fixed, figurative expression that uses the headword. It is indented and bolded like a derived word. |
| **Cross-Reference** | `ለት "እለት"` ን ተመ. <br> `ግንድስ "ገነደሰ"` ስር `"ገንዳሳ"` ን ተመ. | A reference using the abbreviation `ተመ.` ("see") to direct the user to another entry for the definition or for a related word. |

## 6. Conclusion and Acknowledged Limitations (ማጠቃለያ)

The authors conclude by acknowledging that the dictionary, as a first-of-its-kind effort using this new system, has certain limitations and potential errors.

### A. Acknowledged Flaws

*   **Inconsistency:** Collaboration by many authors has led to some inconsistencies in definition style and application of the rules.
*   **Orthographic Challenges:** The new, simplified alphabet is a major change, and the influence of the old system may have resulted in errors.
*   **Technical Errors:** Computer font issues have caused character-rendering problems (e.g., `ን` sometimes appearing as `ነ`).
*   **Specific Errors Mentioned:**
    *   Spelling mistakes (`የፊደል ግድፈቶች`).
    *   Inconsistencies in definition style (`የኣፈታት ዘዬ ወጥነት ጉድለቶች`).
    *   Errors in the hierarchical placement of root and derived words.
    *   Problems with categorizing derived words.
    *   Inconsistent cross-referencing.

### B. Inherent Complexities of Amharic

The authors note that the complexity of the Amharic language itself poses challenges to standardization.

*   **Spelling Variations:** Many words have multiple accepted spellings in common usage, and the dictionary had to choose one.
    *   **Example:** `እንስሳ / እንሰሳ` (animal), `እፅዋት / እፀዋት` (plants), `ረጅም / ረዥም` (tall).
*   **Pluralization Logic:** The relationship between singular and plural forms can be complex, as a plural form can sometimes take on a new, distinct meaning.
    *   **Example:** `ፍሬ` (a single fruit/seed) vs. `ፍራፍሬ` (fruits in general, as a category of food). The dictionary struggles with how to treat `ፍራፍሬ`—as a simple plural or as a new lexical item.
